Google Homepage Clone from The Odin Project Curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

9/2/19
Utilized basic HTML and CSS to make a rough clone of the Google homepage.
Currently missing some symbols (Apps and assistant icon in search bar)
Created fixed header and footer, formatting can be better, not sure how to work around floats yet (flex?).

9/3/19
-Changed to classic Google logo and added image for "Apps" symbol in header
-Reformatted header and footer with flexbox
-Styling changes to make page more accurate to original
