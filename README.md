# google-homepage-clone
Google Homepage Clone from The Odin Project Curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

9/2/19
Utilized basic HTML and CSS to make a rough clone of the Google homepage.
Currently missing some symbols (Apps + Share links and assistant icon in search bar)
Created fixed header and footer, formatting can be better, not sure how to work around floats yet (flex?).
